>Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.

>Note:

>Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

# code
```java
class Solution {
    public int countNodes(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return 0;
        int leftmost = 0;
        TreeNode left = root;
        while (left != null) {
            leftmost ++;
            left = left.left;
        }
        int rightmost = 0;
        TreeNode right = root;
        while (right != null) {
            rightmost ++;
            right = right.right;
        }
        if (leftmost == rightmost) return (int)Math.pow(2, leftmost)-1;
        return 1 + countNodes(root.left) + countNodes(root.right);
    }

}

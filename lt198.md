> You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

> Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

# code
```java
public int rob(int[] nums) {
    int rob = 0;
    int unrob = 0;
    int todayrob = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        //没偷前一家的情况下来偷这一家
        todayrob = unrob + nums[i];
        //不偷这一家的收益=max(没偷前一家,偷了前一家)
        unrob = unrob > rob ? unrob : rob;
        //偷这一家的收益
        rob = todayrob;
    }
    //目前最大收益=max(没偷最后一家,偷了最后一家)
    return unrob > rob ? unrob : rob;
}
```

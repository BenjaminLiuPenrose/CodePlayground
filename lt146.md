# lt146
> Design and implement a data structure for Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. It should support the following operations: get and put.
get(key) - Get the value (will always be positive) of the key if the key exists in the cache, otherwise return -1.
put(key, value) - Set or insert the value if the key is not already present. When the cache reached its capacity, it should invalidate the least recently used item before inserting a new item.
> The cache is initialized with a positive capacity.
> Follow up:
> Could you do both operations in O(1) time complexity?

```Java
class LRUCache {
    private int capacity;
    private LinkedHashMap<Integer, Integer> cache = null;
    
    public LRUCache(int capacity) {
        this.capacity = capacity;
        this.cache = new LinkedHashMap<Integer,Integer>(capacity, .75F, true){
            protected boolean removeEldestEntry(Map.Entry eldest)
            {
                return size() > capacity;
            }
        };
    }
    
    public int get(int key) {
        Integer val = this.cache.get(key);
        if(val == null) { return -1; }
        else { return val; }
    }
    
    public void put(int key, int value) {
        this.cache.put(key, value);
    }
}

/**
 * Your LRUCache object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * LRUCache obj = new LRUCache(capacity);
 * int param_1 = obj.get(key);
 * obj.put(key,value);

> Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

> A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

# code
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isHappy(int n) {
        int temp = n;
        LinkedList<Integer> linkedList = new LinkedList<Integer>(); 
        linkedList.add(temp);
        while (true) {
            temp = getNext(temp);
            if (temp == 1) {
                return true;
            } else if (linkedList.contains(temp)) {
                return false;
            }
            linkedList.add(temp);
        }   
        
    }
    private int getNext(int num) {
        int result = 0;
        while (num > 0) {
            result += (num % 10) * (num % 10);
            num = num / 10;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

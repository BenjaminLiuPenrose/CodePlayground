# N pts in semicircle

## N pts in semicircle
>Prob of N pts all in a semicircle
## code
```
p_n = n * (1/2)^{n-1}
```

## Convex Set
> 0 not in conv{N pts}
## idea
```
p_n = n * (1/3)^{n-1}
```

## sticks to form a triangle
>break stick into three parts and the prob of forming a triangle
## idea
```
1 - p = 3 * (1 / 2)^2
```
